A small collection of hacks and cheats for Risk of Rain 2.

Open to any pull requests.

Doesn't require BepInEx or R2API!

This is an unofficial fork of the Spektre Menu by [BennettStaley](https://github.com/BennettStaley/)
and was merged with [Lodington's](https://github.com/Lodington/) unofficial fork.

This menu is for testing/personal fun. I do not condone the use of this menu in competitive modes such as the Prismatic Trials nor do I condone the use of this menu if it harms the experience of other players in any way. Thank you.

# Getting Started:
## v1.2.4 and above
1. Head to [releases](https://github.com/Acher0ns/Umbra-Menu-Injector/releases/latest/) and download `Umbra-Injector-vX.X.X.zip`
2. Extract the zip.
3. Run `UmbraInjector.exe`
4. Press the `Inject` button while the game is open.

Note: Make sure `UmbraInjector.exe` and the `Data` folder stay in the same directory.

## v1.2.3 and below
### Requirements
- [ ] A Mono Injector. [Sharpmonoinjector](https://github.com/warbler/SharpMonoInjector) is recommended and is used in this tutorial.

Note: Must use the CLI version of sharp mono injector. The GUI version doesn't work properly.


1. Head to [releases](https://github.com/Acher0ns/Umbra-Mod-Menu/releases) and download `UmbraMenu-vX.X.zip`
2. Extract the zip
3. Use your favorite mono injector to inject the dll (If you do not know how to use sharpmonoinjector, scroll down to that section)
```
Namespace: UmbraMenu
Class: Loader
Method: Load
```

## How to use sharpmonoinjector
After you have your dll file, you'll need to have a way to inject it into the game. There are 2 option Command line or with a batch file.
### Command line
1. Once you have sharpmonoinjector downloaded from [here](https://github.com/warbler/SharpMonoInjector/releases/download/v2.2/SharpMonoInjector.Console.zip), extract the zip.

2. Next open a command prompt window as administrator and type the command:

`cd "[path to folder with smi.exe in it]"` 

obviously replacing [path to folder with smi.exe in it] with the proper path (keep the quotes). For example my command is:

`cd "C:\Users\Username\Documents\My Cheats\RoR2\SharpMonoInjector.Console\SharpMonoInjector.Console"`

3. You can tell if you're in the proper directory if you type `dir` and you see SharpMonoInjector.dll and smi.exe listed

4. Once you are in the proper directory and Risk of Rain 2 is open, type 

`smi.exe inject -p "Risk of Rain 2" -a "[Path to UmbraMenu.dll]" -n UmbraMenu -c Loader -m Load` 

again replacing [Path to UmbraMenu.dll] with the proper path (keep the quotes)

### Batch file
1. Once you have sharpmonoinjector downloaded from [here](https://github.com/warbler/SharpMonoInjector/releases/download/v2.2/SharpMonoInjector.Console.zip), extract the zip.
2. Right click on your Desktop -> New -> Text Document
3. Open the text document and paste the following
```
@echo off
cd "[path to folder with smi.exe]"
cls
smi.exe inject -p "Risk of Rain 2" -a "[Path to UmbraMenu.dll]" -n UmbraMenu -c Loader -m Load
pause
```
4. Replace [path to folder with smi.exe] and [Path to UmbraMenu.dll] with the proper paths (keep quotes if they are there)
5. Press ctrl+shift+s and name it `start.bat` (make sure you replace .txt with .bat)
6. If everything was done properly, while the game is open just run `start.bat` as administrator and the Menu should automatically be injected into the game
